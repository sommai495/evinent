completed test task (html and plain javascript) for "Evinent Gmbh" company

below is description of what was to be done as provided by company



The goal of this task is to write a simple HTML/JavaScript program that interacts with the user and draws geometric figures on the screen. The result of the program should be a file named index.html that runs in any browser with the latest version.

Task Description

The user selects four arbitrary points (A, B, C, D) in the client area of the browser. Once selected, the program marks their locations by drawing black circles with a diameter of 5 pixels for each chosen point.

Based on these four points, the program should construct two figures:

• A blue circle centered at point A, with a radius equal to the distance from point A to point B.
• A yellow circle centered at point C, with a radius equal to the distance from point C to point D.

The coordinates of the selected points, as well as the coordinates of the intersection points of the two circles, must be numerically displayed to the user.
The user should be able to freely move the points around the screen at any time. Moving the points should dynamically update the drawing of the circles and display the updated figures and their coordinates.

There must also be a "reset" function that clears the area and allows the user to select four new points and repeat the entire process described above.
Additionally, an "about" function should be implemented that provides your personal information about the program, its author, and instructions for use.
